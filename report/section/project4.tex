\section{Project 4 - Image Restoration}
\subsection{Project Proposal}
First implement the random noise generation functions. The random noise functions include uniform, Gaussian, Rayleigh, Gamma, exponential and impulse. Requirement is that only uniform noise is allowed to use built-in function while any other noise should be generated based on uniform noise with self-defined functions. The test image is \emph{Fig0503.tif}.
Second follow the process shown in textbook \emph{FIGURE 5.7, FIGURE 5.8, FIGURE 5.10, FIGURE 5.11, FIGURE 5.12}. Each figure displays a process of add some specified type of noise and then use restoration method to reduce noise.
