target of parameter tuning is to get similar performance to the figured showed in the text book figure5.4

generate noisy, add to origin gray level matrix and apply scaling to 0-255.

uniform noisy 

 	a = 0, b = 70
 	

Gaussian noisy 
	
	mean = 80 , variance = 25  


Rayleigh noisy 

	low bound = 90, sigma = 30


restoration in the presence of noise only - spatial filtering
